# Mobile-Games-A-B-Testing-with-Cookie-Cats
Welcome to the "Mobile Games A/B Testing with Cookie Cats" project! This project dives into the analysis of an A/B test where the first gate in the popular mobile puzzle game, Cookie Cats, was moved from level 30 to level 40. We aim to assess the impact of this change on player retention.
